# ‚ùì FAQ

* Can I still propose vanilla blocks?
* Can't restaking do all of this?
* Can you have based sequencing without preconfirmations?
  * Yes! It's just slow. The same speed as the L1 as a best case.
* Why would a centralized L2 sequencer give up control over their sequencing to the L1 proposers?
