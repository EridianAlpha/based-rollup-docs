# 💎 Based Rollups

## ⏱️ Based Rollups in 60 seconds

Ethereum is the most credibly neutral and censorship-resistant shared consensus protocol humanity has ever created. It's the geographically, economically, and culturally diverse validator set that makes this possible. Rollups are an extension of Ethereum, but currently, nearly all rollups use their own validator set, usually a single centralized sequencer. This limits composability and causes liquidity fragmentation, creating "island nations" rather than a unified Ethereum. Based rollups solve this problem by giving the power to sequence transactions in a rollup to the same validator proposing the L1 block. There are huge benefits to Ethereum from this arrangement which will be explained in detail on this site.

## **🤔 I'm an Ethereum Validator - Why should I care about Based Rollups?**

Being a Based Rollup sequencer is opt-in, so by default you don't have to care. MEV-Boost is an example of something that you as an Ethereum validator can opt-in to and increase your revenue from block proposals, but you can also choose not to use it.

So what are the benefits for a validator who opts-in?

* You earn more rewards as you're taking on more duties.
* You improve the user experience of Ethereum by enabling L1 and L2 preconfirmations.
* You improve the liveness and security of L2s.

## 👨🏻‍💻 About the author

I'm [Eridian](https://eridian.xyz) and my passion is education around all things Ethereum. I wrote the [EthStaker](https://docs.ethstaker.cc) docs and know that as the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the knowledge required to navigate it! This documentation site is designed to concisely explain what Based Rollups are, how they impact Ethereum validators, and how you can be involved in the next phase of the rollup-centric roadmap.

## 📚 Background context

There's a lot of background context that needs to be understood for the concepts explained here so as a starting point you should be familiar with Ethereum staking.

{% hint style="info" %}
The content on this site is aimed at anyone who is already running an Ethereum validator and wants to learn about Based Rollups.
{% endhint %}

This site won't explain how to set up an Ethereum validator or go through all the different permutations of staking e.g. DVT, Restaking, etc. If you need information on those concepts check out the [EthStaker](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/) docs.
