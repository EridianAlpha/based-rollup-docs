# ðŸ”— Restaking just with extra steps?

**Here's a thought experiment:** What would happen if MEV Boost required all Ethereum validators to set their withdrawal address to a smart contract that Flashbots controlled? Flashbots could say this is to protect block builders from validators who do not propose the block they promised. All the benefits of using MEV Boost would still exist. You would still earn significantly higher rewards and you'd theoretically be able to withdraw your validator and get your ETH back any time you want. All you have to do is trust Flashbots. Trust.

This is the reality of restaking for validators. For a little extra yield, you give up control over your ETH and trust that the restaking provider will be able to give it back when you ask.

"Ok" you say, "But DeFi, lending, borrowing, tokens, they all require you to trust someone and put assets into smart contracts". Yes, and that might be fine for DeFi and every application built on top of Ethereum, but not for Ethereum itself.

**Here's another thought experiment:** Imagine waking up tomorrow to find that your country's military and police have been replaced by a single private security firm. Would you feel safer? The security of your nation has been handed over to a private company that you didn't vote for (in a democracy at least) and now has total control to enforce the law.

Restaking "squeezes" the security of Ethereum, compressing it into the hands that govern a small number of restaking protocols.

Restaking has a lot of use cases, but securing the majority of Ethereum should not be one of them. It would be an attack on the network in the same way a single LST provider capturing the majority of staked ETH would be an attack.
