# ü§î Why rollups not MORE L1?

Ethereum L1 is slow. Why is it slow? To allow for true decentralization the hardware, bandwidth and technical requirements must remain low üó∫Ô∏è&#x20;

It's not a secret that faster block times would greatly improve the user experience on Ethereum which is why the "Rollup Centric Roadmap" has been actively developed since XX.

## Ethereum L2s - More clicks, faster ticks ‚úÖ

Rollups Can have much shorter block times as they manage their own state and only snapshots of that state are stored on Ethereum using `blobs`. <mark style="color:yellow;">TODO: Rephrase to better explain what blobs are</mark>

If at time t=0 a user starts with 1 ETH in their wallet on an L2:

* t=2s the user buys an NFT on the L2
* t=4s the NFT is used in a game and the player wins 0.1 ETH
* t=6s the user sells the NFT for a profit of 0.2 ETH
* t=8s the user takes a break, it's been a busy 8 seconds!
* t=10s the user trades their ETH profits for USDC

At t=12s the L1 proposes the next block and the L2 bids to include the changes made by the user during the previous 12 seconds. This was a great experience for the user, every interaction they had with the L2 felt almost instantaneous and they were never even aware of the slower L1 block times.

It's the interface bettween this seperate states that are the difference between an Ethereum L2, a side chain and an alternative L1.
