# ✅ What are we waiting for?

## More clicks, faster ticks ✅

Rollups can have much shorter block times as they manage their own state and only snapshots of that state are stored on Ethereum.

If at time t=0 a user starts with 1 ETH in their wallet on an L2:

* t=2s the user buys an NFT on the L2
* t=4s the NFT is used in a game and the player wins 0.1 ETH
* t=6s the user sells the NFT for a profit of 0.2 ETH
* t=8s the user takes a break, it's been a busy 8 seconds!
* t=10s the user trades their ETH profits for RAI

At t=12s the L1 proposes the next block and the L2 bids to include the changes made by the user during the previous 12 seconds. This was a great experience for the user, every interaction they had with the L2 felt almost instantaneous and they were never even aware of the slower L1 block times.
